# The k8s cert manager is required by this deployment, but it's not automatically deployed as part of the bootstrap script 
# as it is a system-wide service which may already exist and be used by other applications. This script is provided as a
# convenient way to deploy the cert-manager if needed. Note that the cert-manager is not uninstalled as part of the teardown
# script, so must be removed manually.

#Â This script follows the Helm-based installation instructions as per https://cert-manager.io/v1.9-docs/installation/helm/
