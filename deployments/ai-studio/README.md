# Tyk AI Studio

To run Tyk AI Studio:

1. Add your license to `.env`:

`DASHBOARD_LICENCE=<YOUR_AI_STUDIO_LICENSE>`

**Note:** This uses the same licence as the Dashboard, so if you have already added your Dashboard licence you can skip this step.

2. Run the Tyk Demo `up.sh` script with the `ai-studio` argument:

```shell
./up.sh ai-studio
```

3. Visit AI Studio in your browser at http://localhost:3011

4. Log on using:

```
dev@tyk.io
