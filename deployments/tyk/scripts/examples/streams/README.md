# Tyk Streams Examples

These directories contain examples related to the Tyk Streams functionality.

Each directory contains scripts that demonstrate the functionality. Where there are multiple scripts, they are often designed be run in separate terminals, to demonstrate functionality from both the publisher and subscriber perspectives.

The scripts output text to explain what they are doing. Some scripts require particular CLI tools that may not be available by default, in this case the script will check that the tool is available.
