#!/bin/bash

# This script run tests from all Tyk Demo deployments
# Deployments are processed consecutively in alphabetical order
# Expect the script to take a while to complete, as each deployment has to be created, tested and removed
# For a deployment to be tested, three criteria must be met:
#   1. The deployment must contain a correctly-named Postman collection: e.g. for development directory "foo-bar", the postman collection should be called "tyk_demo_foo_bar.postman_collection.json"
#   2. The Postman collection must contain at least one test
#   3. The deployment must be successfully created
# Deployments which don't meet the criteria are skipped
# A test is considered successful if a deployment can be created, tested and removed without error
# The scope of testing is limited to the tests defined within the Postman collection
# If no tests fail then this script will exit with a 0, otherwise it will be a non-zero value
# Tests may fail due to environmental reasons, so if you experience a failure it's worth checking that it wasn't caused by an environmental error, such as lack of resources
# The script must be run from the repository root i.e. ./scripts/test-all.sh
